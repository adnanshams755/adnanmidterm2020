Please read the questions and answer.

What is Database?
A.A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system

What is DBMS?
A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define,
manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data
itself, the data format, field names, record structure and file structure

What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
SQL is used in the accessing, updating, and manipulation of data in a database
while MySQL is an RDBMS that allows keeping the data that exists in a database organized.
SQL is a Structured Query Language and MySQL is a RDBMS to store, retrieve, modify and administrate a database


What is RDBMS? How is it different from DBMS?
Key Difference between DBMS and RDBMS: The key difference
is that RDBMS (relational database management system) applications store data in a tabular form,
while DBMS applications store data as files

What are Tables and Fields?
In database, a table is a data structure where data can be organized in fields
(columns) & records (rows). For example, information of the employees of an organization needs to be stored.
 A record represents set of related data. Complete set of values for all column/field is called record or row

What is SQL?
Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database

What are Constraints in SQL?
Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table.
These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table

What is a Primary Key?
A primary key is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically
generated by the database according to a defined sequence. For example, students are routinely
assigned unique identification (ID) numbers, and all adults receive government-assigned and
uniquely-identifiable Social Security numbers.

What is a Foreign Key?
A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables

What is Normalization?
Normalization is the process of reducing the duplication of the data

What is Denormalization?
Denormalization is a strategy that database managers use to increase the
performance of a database infrastructure. It involves adding redundant data to a normalized database to
reduce certain types of problems with database queries that combine data from various tables into a single table

You have 2 tables given below.
